<h1>Stack and Queue</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I completed these projects originally during my data structures and algorithms class. However, I have updated it for this repository. It demonstrates how to make stacks and queues and their member functions that allow for their manipulation. The stack and queue are limited to a set amount of integers; in the code provided, they are set to a maximum of five. I used driver code on both to test their functionality(shown below).
